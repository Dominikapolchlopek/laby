Master and Apprentice Dynamic
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Master-Apprentice relationship is a traditional and fundamental aspect of the Jedi Order. Qui-Gon is portrayed as a wise and somewhat unconventional Jedi who often follows his instincts and the will of the Force, even if it means going against the Jedi Council's directives. Obi-Wan, as the apprentice, respects Qui-Gon but is also mindful of the Jedi Code and the Council's authority.

Differences in Approach
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan have different approaches to the Force and the Jedi way. Qui-Gon is more attuned to the living Force and is open to unconventional methods. He believes in following the will of the Force, even if it means challenging the Jedi Council. Obi-Wan, while respectful of Qui-Gon, tends to adhere more closely to the Jedi Code and Council decisions.

Discovery of Anakin Skywalker
----------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the pivotal moments in their relationship occurs when Qui-Gon discovers Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine. Qui-Gon senses the boy's strong connection to the Force and believes him to be the Chosen One destined to bring balance to the Force. Despite the Jedi Council's reservations, Qui-Gon is determined to train Anakin as a Jedi, and this decision sets the stage for future events.


Qui-Gon's Influence on Obi-Wan
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Qui-Gon's teachings and beliefs leave a lasting impact on Obi-Wan. Even after Qui-Gon's death at the hands of Darth Maul, Obi-Wan carries on his master's commitment to training Anakin. Qui-Gon's emphasis on following the will of the Force and his belief in Anakin's potential continue to shape Obi-Wan's decisions and actions throughout the prequel trilogy.

Legacy and Reflections
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qui-Gon's influence is felt beyond his physical presence in the films. In "Star Wars: The Clone Wars" animated series, Qui-Gon's voice is heard communicating with Yoda, emphasizing the continued existence of a Jedi's consciousness after death. This concept adds a spiritual dimension to the Jedi philosophy and underscores Qui-Gon's unique connection to the Force.

The relationship between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi is a crucial element in the broader Star Wars narrative, influencing the characters' development and the events that unfold, particularly in the prequel trilogy.

Anakin is discovered by Qui-Gon Jinn, who believes he is the Chosen One destined to bring balance to the Force. Despite the Jedi Council's reservations, Obi-Wan follows his late master's wishes and trains Anakin. The training process, however, is challenging due to Anakin's strong emotions, impulsive nature, and the fear that he harbors.

Brotherly Bond
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the years, Obi-Wan and Anakin develop a brotherly bond. Despite their differences, they share a deep mutual respect and affection. Obi-Wan becomes not just a mentor but also a friend to Anakin. This bond is evident in their interactions and shared experiences throughout "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones" and "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith."

Challenges and Tensions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anakin's inner struggles, fear of loss, and desire for power create tensions in the relationship. Anakin often feels constrained by the Jedi Code and the Council's rules, and he perceives Obi-Wan as holding him back. This strain on their bond is exacerbated by external factors, such as Anakin's secret marriage to Padm√© Amidala and his visions of her death.

Anakin's Fall to the Dark Side
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The turning point in their relationship comes in "Revenge of the Sith" when Anakin falls to the dark side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader. Manipulated by Emperor Palpatine (Darth Sidious), Anakin turns against the Jedi, including Obi-Wan. The emotional duel on the volcanic planet of Mustafar is a heartbreaking moment, with Obi-Wan expressing his deep disappointment and sadness at Anakin's choices.

Legacy and Redemption
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite the tragic events that lead to Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader, there is a glimmer of hope in the belief that there is still good in him. Obi-Wan, Yoda, and later, Luke Skywalker, believe in Anakin's potential for redemption. This theme is further explored in the original trilogy.

This reunion is a poignant and emotional moment, as Ahsoka comes face to face with the person Anakin has become.

Impact on Anakin's Character
